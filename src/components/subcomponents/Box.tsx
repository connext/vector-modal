/// TODO: Replace Chakra Box component. This should be extremely simple, just a div (column) with flex row.
/// We may need to fine tune the sizing for mobile, etc., however.
/// Also, we may want to rename from Box -> Column or something, as Stack may be Chakra-exclusive terminology.
/// See also: Box.tsx
