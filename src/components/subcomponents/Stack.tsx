/// TODO: Replace Chakra Stack component. This should be extremely simple, just a div with flex column.
/// We may need to fine tune the sizing for mobile, etc., however.
/// Also, we may want to rename from Stack -> Grid or something, as Stack may be Chakra-exclusive terminology.
/// See also: Box.tsx
